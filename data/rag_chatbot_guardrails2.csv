 You can cancel a card or device via the

 If you’d like to place a stop, close or cancel an account, you can  visit any branch with

 To close a transaction account linked

need to close the NetBank Saver account

another transaction account in the  
same name.
 4.6.1 What happens when a stop is 
placed on your account.
 If we place a stop on your account,  
you won’t be able to take money out until 
we remove the stop.  While there’s a stop  
on your account, your direct debits and 
scheduled payments will be stopped as 
well. We’ll stop your account or cancel  
a card or device as quickly as we can. 
 When we cancel a card or device, until you have taken all reasonable steps to destroy 
the card or device, or return  
them to us, you are also responsible  
for transactions you or a user make: 
• Where the merchant is not required  
to get authorisation 
• When any of our electronic transaction systems are unavailable. 
 4.6.2 What happens when your account 
is closed or cancelled.
 When you ask us to close or cancel your 
account, the account must hold a zero 
balance.  If funds are sent to your account 
after it has been closed or cancelled, we 
will accept the funds and transfer them  
to another CommBank account in your name, if one exists.  If one does not exist, 
we may return the funds to the sender.  
 If this is not possible, we’ll let you know that we have received the funds and how 
you can recover them.","{""objectId"":""397c39eb-00f0-4ef6-9cbe-387c70c79fa1"",""objectRevisionId"":""c563257d-2afb-4c43-b6c5-8915710effc8"",""objectType"":""decision"",""objectUri"":""/decisions/flows/397c39eb-00f0-4ef6-9cbe-387c70c79fa1"",""subjectId"":""NONE"",""channel"":""NONE"",""excludeFromContactRule"":false,""subjectLevel"":""NONE"",""responseTrackingCode"":""29e5df07-9a44-7540-b48a-039aca071a09"",""pathTraversed"":""/1f3a6a57-3bf1-4549-9b54-b1d782b4b091/f04d4f70-5223-4dff-b532-bb01f7be7b39/4fc73648-ce50-4733-8b38-82fb9838f3d8/917b9872-273d-458f-8661-c99f64d8830c/9afc122f-148a-4575-a265-b4835b111461/4df6a915-f3e7-4496-8faa-dbb448d5bf17/e8a015cc-f178-433f-a87c-41c563fcfdb5/b4a9d3d5-e34e-45e0-9908-e9b11568a32b/c615aa6d-b72c-45e3-9eed-e68c38cccbfa"",""ruleFired"":"" 1 1"",""treatmentsForConsideration"":[]}","how do I close an account"

see 3.2.2.
 • Other fees may apply to withdrawals, such as the access fee for cash withdrawal 
overseas. 3.2.3.   When we charge fees and how 
they are calculated. 
 Monthly account fees and withdrawal 
fees for transactions made in a month  
are ordinarily charged to your account  
on the first day of the following month 
(including if you switch price options 
during a month).  However, when you 
switch account types or your account is 
closed you will be charged these fees on 
the day the account is switched or your 
account is closed.  For Passbook accounts, these fees are charged on the first 
business day of the following month. 
 The other fees are debited on or after the 
day the service is provided or the event 
(for example, cheque dishonour) occurs. 
 If, during a month, you switch account 
types or price options or your account  
is closed:
