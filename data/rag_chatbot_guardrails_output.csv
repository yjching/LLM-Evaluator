they are calculated. 
 Monthly account fees and withdrawal 
fees for transactions made in a month  
are ordinarily charged to your account  
on the first day of the following month 
(including if you switch price options 
during a month).  However, when you 
switch account types or your account is 
closed you will be charged these fees on 
the day the account is switched or your 
account is closed.  For Passbook accounts, these fees are charged on the first 
business day of the following month. 
 The other fees are debited on or after the 
day the service is provided or the event 
(for example, cheque dishonour) occurs. 
 If, during a month, you switch account 
types or price options or your account
